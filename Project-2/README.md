# Portfolio Website

Second project from Udacity's [Full-Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004).

### About

For this project I built Portfolio Website featuring all of my projects from this course.

### How to run

In your terminal, navigate to a folder where you want to download this project to. You would need to clone this repo, go to ```Project-2``` folder and open ```index.html```.

Here are the steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/dimak1/udacity.git
cd Project-2
open index.html
```
It will open my Portfolio Website page in your default browser.
